Apache Spark is a unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing.
Spark provides high-level APIs in Java, Scala, Python and R.
It also supports a rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and structured data processing.
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing, and Structured Streaming for incremental computation and stream processing.
Spark is designed to be fast and general purpose.
Spark can run on Hadoop, Apache Mesos, Kubernetes, standalone, or in the cloud.
It can access diverse data sources including HDFS, Apache Cassandra, Apache HBase, and Amazon S3.
Spark is an open-source project that is used by thousands of companies for data processing.
The project was started at UC Berkeley in 2009 and has since become one of the most active Apache projects.
Spark continues to evolve with new features and improvements in every release.
Apache Hadoop is a framework for distributed storage and processing of large data sets.
Hadoop uses the MapReduce programming model for processing data.
HDFS is the primary storage system used by Hadoop applications.
Hadoop is highly scalable and can process petabytes of data.
The Hadoop ecosystem includes many tools like Hive, Pig, HBase, and Sqoop.
Big Data processing requires distributed computing frameworks like Spark and Hadoop.
Data engineers use Spark and Hadoop to build data pipelines and analytics applications.
Machine learning models can be trained on large datasets using Spark MLlib.
Real-time data processing is possible with Spark Streaming.
Cloud computing platforms provide managed services for running Spark and Hadoop clusters.
